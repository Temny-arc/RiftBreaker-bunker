enterance_item0?;there apears to be an interesting item lying on the floor do you want to pick it? yes = 0 no =1
enterance_item0a;Its a bandage, this could prove usefully, tho someone used it before
enterance_item0b;There is something that dont fit here.
enterance_item1?;When you look at the wall you see an old mech it may prove useful in defence. do you want to activate it? yes = 0 no =1
enterance_item1a;Mech seams to be active but it will need a pilot, you informed commander about it. He replied: "thank you"
enterance_item1b;It may be dangerous to activate it so you decided to not turn it on.
enterance_item2?;On the ground there is a something that reflects the light its buried in snow. Do you want to look at it? yes = 0 no =1
enterance_item2a;Once you look get close you find that it was a light bump. But there isnt any light broken.
enterance_item2b;It cant be that interesting you have other things to do
enterance_item3?;When you are looking at the snow you see foot trails, they lead to a small room do you want to check it out? yes = 0 no =1
enterance_item3a;When you enter the room some enemy jumps on you. FIGHT!
enterance_item3b;Those foot trails are interesting, but it may be a trap.
enterance_item4?;On the left there is a locked container do you want to open it? yes = 0 no =1
enterance_item4a;It took a while, but you managed to open it. Unfortunately there is nothing inside
enterance_item4b;It lock frozen and there is probably nothing in it anyway.

enterance_item5a;Cable is cold, yet you can feel warm from the below. The reason why its in here is remain of some item that was slammed here
enterance_item5b;It may be dangerous. Better not walk close near it
hallway_item0?;You notice that part of the floor is missing. It looks like it's some kind of power structure. It may help outside. Do you want to use it? yes = 0 no =1
hallway_item1?;Data from area are clear if portal is powered somewhere its here. Data also points that if you turn it of a huge icy wave will apear. End the game by turning of the portal. yes = 0 no =1
hallway_item1a;Kind of tough decide which of your friends got to die, Isn't it? Good news is you got this one choom who is already dead.
hallway_item1a+;And he`d be honored to join you on a wild suicide run. You me and the Frost Spirit. Kinda sounds like Eurodyne lyric, I know, but trust me we`ll go fuckin` nova.
hallway_item1a+-;This plan, what would it entail, exactly?
hallway_item1a++;"Plan?" Well, might be how Rouge operates. I say you grab the hottest iron you can find, stride to the Bunker front door and cut your own path to the Portal.
hallway_item1a+++;If Control is so outside, like data points it is. You`ll just have to find a car.
hallway_item1a++-;If I gotta die, rather fall into my grave gun in hand and on fire. And not draw anyone down with me.
hallway_item1a++++;Huh, you just discoverer what il takes to become a legend... Grab your iron      -let`s mobilise.
bedroom_items0-6?;You notice bunch of crates in this room and some beds tied to them. If you want to investigate type a-f or 1-6.
bedroom_item0a;This crate contains mostly clothes. Strange that you found a hazmat suit so there must be a lab somewhere.
bedroom_item1a;This crate have some diary in it if you want to read it. yes = 0 no = 1
bedroom_item1a+;Hah this is my first day here. The place is big. Fascinating there is a reactor below us. Still dunno why. continue? yes = 0 no = 1
bedroom_item1a++;I met some guy he seems cute, Unfortunately I have still so much to do I just cant talk to him. continue? yes = 0 no = 1
bedroom_item1a+++;I talked to him he was so nervous. I also played with some guy. It was so funny.Looks like there is only one page left. ;this cant bot read how to get any roblox girl to play with you
bedroom_item1a++++;He is gone, why? why me? I`m giving up. So I signed as volunteer for the new project. I will probably not return but if yes I will find him.
bedroom_item2a;Why is in this crate a cup. Like here is only coffee. also some coffee machine.;Kucharik pt0
bedroom_item3a;Looks like a lot of books not, most are from known people like Steve Armstrong, Michael Kovac etc. but one is from some Vladimir Putin?;note Here isnt the same timeline like russia is controlled by some corp
bedroom_item4a;Interesting, in the bottom of the crate is shotgun also ammo. the rest looks more like trash
bedroom_item5a;Someone decided to use his stash as botanist supply. now it looks more like spoilage, there is also note Gleba on it.
bathroom_item0?;You notice a small card in the sink
bathroom_item0a;It turns out to be a blue keycard. Interesting is that its color is blue and has A and C on it.
bathroom_item1?;There are some noises in the shower.
bathroom_item1+;When you look to the shower. You notice a man being cornered by a frost creature FIGHT !!
bathroom_item1-;When you look to the shower. You notice a dead body and some thing made of frost FIGHT !!
bathroom_item1a;Men replied thank you. And then ask who you are you replied: I m searching for a safe spot.
bathroom_item1a-;Body contained almost nothing exept a note turn on the f****** generator.
bathroom_item2?;There is a interesting locker on the side. do you want to open it.
bathroom_item2a;It turns out to be a blue keycard. Interesting is that its color is blue and has A and C on it.
kitchen_item0?;There may be something in the fridge. Do you want to check it out?
kitchen_item0a;Its interesting there is nothing in there .
kitchen_item1?;There is some book in kitchen part. It could prove useful.
kitchen_item1a;Once you open the book, its cookbook you notice some marks. One have some wierd note: Gift for David from a friend. Than: David is dead, so nothing I guess.;note David is the loved one from the diary in the bedroom
kitchen_item2?;Wardrobe may have some medication or a weapon. It maybe good to investigate.
kitchen_item2a;There is a knife, It's something at least.
kitchen_item3?;Someone left data-tablet on the table. There may be some data in it.
kitchen_item3a;Tablet have mostly data about some Frost creatures Frost-Baller, Frost-Hunter, Frost-Necromancer and something called as Frost Spirit. You can find more if you want to
kitchen_item3a+;"Frost-Baller" is creature looking as a human. Its best ability is throwing snowballs. By using some magic(we still dont know how) it can increase durability of the snowball. It main problem is legs are really weak.
kitchen_item3a++;"Frost-Hunter" is refered for beeing identical with cave men. Has perfect perception, can track down almost everything. They are pact so you mostly newer run into only one. if you hurt his head it will be almost dead.
kitchen_item3a+++;"Frost-Necromancer" also known as Summoner creates other frost enemies he probably also controls them so killing one can have huge Impact on others. He himself is weak but since he is protected by others its always strong foe.
kitchen_item3a++++;Frost-Spirit: we expect to be a leader of the Frost people, yet we are not sure if its some mental connection or Person behind it all. if you ever encounter him, know that he can be defeated by huge power only.
kitchen_item4?;There is a stack of paper. It can be searched to gain some info.
kitchen_item4a;Some papers are reports from other people, one cathed your eye titled: If MechTech fine what we are doing here we are screwed. Do you want to read the whole article?
kitchen_item4a+;If they find out we are using a portal they will send entire army to wipe this place of the map. One day we will need to escape this place. If that happens project Vulcan will need to continue elsewhere.
techrooma_item0?;Looks like someone have lot of storage data here. There is also a button that is blinking, titled restart. do you want to press it.
techrooma_item0a;Once you press it. You hear a women voice. Hello how can I help today. This must be an AI for the complex. You can now talk to AI using dialog.
techrooma_item1?;There is a orange card on the table do you want to pick it?
techrooma_item1a;Once you pick the card up you notice letters A and B; note A is research data access B is tech room access C lab access D is for scout teams and E is for carrying guns
techrooma_item2?;There is a slot for a card. What does it does.;here you need D card its for a gun outside
techrooma_item2a;Once you swipe a card. AI talked about. Defensive turret being active. it is probably for the guys outside
techrooma_item2a+;Once you swipe a card nothing happens. AI mentioned you need a D card to activate it.
techrooma_item3?;There is temperature controller on the wall. Since the frost enemy are frozen it can weaken them.
techrooma_item3a;Something wierd happens. Temperature falls. when you try to return it back nothing happens ; Its for the reactor down there It weakens foe there
techroomb_item0-;Doors look locked. they will need power to open them. But the complex dont have almost any. You need to find a power source to open it.
techroomb_item0+;Doors are open you can now enter.
techroomb_item1+;Someone had a shop there. some useful items may be found here
stairs_item;Doors lead into the reactor. If you want to help others you best start here. are you ready
stairs_items?;Reactor looks by readings normal but there is something that is reducing its power. When you walk closer you see a Frost enemy with a staff. Its a necromancer.
stairs_items+?;So what to do you must kill it the easiest method is to overload reactor and burn that thing, but you will lose access here. You can also challenge him and kill him yourself
stairs_itema-;Due reactor overload area is no longer accessible.
stairs_itema+;You can enter now.
stairs_item0?;Below you is a large stockpile of ice, why?
stairs_item0a;Its a water generator, for a some reason room is also making some rocket fuel than burn it.
stairs_item1?;There is a large furnace, but there is something stuck inside of it.
stairs_item1a;Inside is a blade its hot. there is no way someone can take it out;have fun this is Sam`s family blade so dont fear the reaper will contain it
stairs_item2?;You see a control device at the reactor. can you use it?
stairs_item2a;It allows to increase the temperature of the base, only for some time tho.
stairs_item3?;Someone wrote some words on the wall
stairs_item3a;All looks same but the writing is bad if you read it correctly then all is Gleba so it looks like Gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba gleba...
stairs_moveup-;Doors are magnetic. it will need power to open them. There must be reactor. nearby
stairs_moveup+;Doors can be opened. IA alerted you: Large amount of enemies are present in next floor exercise caution.
stairs_movedown;You moved down
cablecar_item;There is a cable car. This can evacuate you to safety but there is a problem its broken. New objective fix Cable car.
cablecar_item0?;On the wall is a blueprint, some technology can prove useful
cablecar_item0a;Its a knife blueprint. Title Mafia Old Country knife. description mentions about this thing is able to pass through solid objects to hit its target.; based on video I broke MAFIA: The Old Country (I'm sorry) In czech: Rozbil jsem MAFIA: Domovina (Omlouvám se)
cablecar_item1?;Looks like the engine is broken you will need to fix it if you want to get out.
cablecar_item1a;By using fixing equipment motor looks good to go.;Its located in TechRoom B
cablecar_item2?;The exit route is blocked by snow. You need to find a way how to open it.
cablecar_item2a;Alice was capable to remove the barrier so the path is clear.
cableoperator_items?;This is a place that will allow you operate Cable car. The only thing here is the control is missing.
cableoperator_item0?;You see a poster on the wall you could look at it.
cableoperator_item0a;Its a poster of some girl but you cant remember who is she, tho there is written BethyVA ; get away from me john
cableoperator_item1?;There is a computer do you want to read files in it.;This is Davids Computer so have fun
cableoperator_item1a;Log1: Why I got this room, Im here alone but director mentioned something about secret research. I will be working on other planets. I cant just believe it.
cableoperator_item1a+;Log2: I talked with John about our game. He told me its halfway done i believe we are much slower than expected. Also John having his youtube channel that he have to upload in sad.
cableoperator_item1a++;Log3: I like some girl here. what was her name? dunno, anyway i asked her for a date in some game John gave me some tips what to do, he have a lot of experience. We will see tomorrow.
cableoperator_item1a+++;Log4: First and second step was easy, but third was hard. It took a lot of time, but I believe she enjoyed it. But I guess she dont like me. Like why is she always avoiding me.
cableoperator_item1a++++;Log5: This will be my last log here but there is no way we will all return from there. I gave Steve love letter that he is supposed to deliver if I die there. But if i die i will with get away from me David.; note Get Away from me John
experimentallab_item0?;On the wall you see a lot of holes. This may help you understand what is going on here
experimentallab_item0a;For a unknown reason some holes are hot still. they more look like cold magma. Whatever they were doing here was dangerous.
experimentallab_item1?;There are some polystyrene statues, but parts of them are on the ground.
experimentallab_item1a;Someone did clear-cut with some melee weapon there may be blueprints nearby.
experimentallab_item2?;Someone left a gun on the floor, time to take matters into my own hands;
experimentallab_item2a;Its a minigun. Someone left note have fun. Time go brr; the person in game creator BelowNatural also known as King of delays
experimentallab_item3?;There is a computer on the table. If you look close you see Insert keycard;This need A access to open it
experimentallab_item3-?;Access denied
experimentallab_item3+?;Access accepted
experimentallab_item3a;Computer opens, There are some files titled project vulcan
experimentallab_item3a+;User alert, portal stability 20% and increasing, warning portal stability 50% and increasing, portal fully stable, warning an unknown entities are emerging from the portal, code red indicated. Shutting down the portal.
experimentallab_item3a++;System is finally working now, we have managed to get some materials from crop1. They look strong, but they all so light we sent them to lab for further study.
experimentallab_item3a++;After some attempts we have discovered some gateway on Thanaad7 there were some locals who defended that place. If we find how that thing works we can escalate our work here.
experimentallab_item3a+++;The gateway is active. there is a issue that some frost enetities are moving from it. The place might have been their jail of some sort. but fortunately, looks like we will purge them.
experimentallab_item3a++++;By using the materials from crop1 we have managed to create super-powerful ammo, but its so cost inefficient. There was an idea to forge some blade that could cut through any material like butter.
experimentallab_item3a+++++;Frost enemies have overrun our base at Thanaad7 but, the data we got are good, so we dont have to take it back. Now we need to find more data or program vulcan is doomed
experimentallab_item4?;There is some large machine on the left side of the room you can activate it.
experimentallab_item4a;Systems are activating, it's a energy shield with some work you managed to fill entire base good job.
manufactory_item0?;On the wall is pipe. it looks hot. there may be a way how to move that heat.
manufactory_item0a;There are four valves. time for a puzzle.
manufactory_item0a+;Once valves are set. You hear commander calling you. "what have you done you bastard hahaha really good job out there".
manufactory_item1?;Forge looks intact you may be able to make some weapon.
manufactory_item1a;Here is a list of items you can make:
manufactory_item1+?;You managed to get the blueprint for a Mafia knife you can make it here.;This is Mafia Old Country knife
manufactory_item1++?;There is some blueprint for a sword or katana. It looks durable, It's made of Glemium.;This is galaxy sword
manufactory_item1+-?;There is also a different thing called heat seeking briefcase.;Hitman reference its one of the most insane items.
manufactory_item1+++?;You can use the acid on the sword here to enhance its power but there is also a risk from damage;This is galaxy sword
manufactory_item1a+;Once Mafia knife is done you can feel some force that directs you to trow it into any spot.;this is for its heat seeking or something
manufactory_item1a++;The sword shines with pink color but, there is missing something in it. (blade also whispers: Consume)
manufactory_item2?;There is some trash lying around. Once you look closer you see some fragments.
manufactory_item2a;When the alarm started someone was forging a weapon but it was done too late to be useful, hopefully you dont meet the same fate.
manufactory_item3?;Someone have radio here but why there are notes on it. some music can help
manufactory_item3a;The note is for user its written: if someone turn this thing on everyone in the base will hear that. I will attempt to fix it soon. Hmm this can play songs to all base lets see what we have got here;
manufactory_item3a+;The list of songs that you can play titled. I'm still standing, Fireworks, Rules of nature, Red sun, Subzero, In case of emergency play this; the songs give bonus value each does diferent scale frow best to worst: Subzero, Red sun, Firework, Rules of nature, I'm still standing and the last In case of emergency play this = I really want to stay at your house(it lowers your survival
cryochamber_item0?;There is a stasis pod here. there is someone inside. You must find a way how to get him out.
cryochamber_item0a+;Issue: The stasis pod is locked. there are some ways how to open it. You can solve a puzzle in order to open it. Find the switch.
cryochamber_item0a-;Or you can use keycard that you have found;you need A card
cryochamber_item0a++;Once the pod is open you hear someone talking that must be the person. It turns out to be a women. She introduce yourself as Alice. She will follow you around.woman woman woman
cryochamber_item1?;There is some container on the far side of the room there is something flowing in it.
cryochamber_item1a;When you walk close you see a tank. You behold an abomination, some sort of hybrid between human and frost monsters. Whoever done that has to pay.
cryochamber_item2?;There is a medical cabinet on the wall close to you. some medical supplies may be inside.
cryochamber_item2a;For a some reason the cabinet holds almost nothing, but there is something at least. it's a stimpack, in combat this may be worthy.
cryochamber_item3?;There is some table with a data-tablet it can store useful intel
cryochamber_item3a;We have old tech here its bad, but with a lot of patience, we have found that you can use sulfuric acid, you can dissolve all frost enemies, we will see if other works as well
cryochamber_item3a+;After analysing items from crop1 we can confirm that local atmosphere is normal almost same as here. There is also a new material we decided to call it Riftium, its mix between gold and tungsten plus some silicic, its extremely durable but also light
cryochamber_item3a++;We reached a breakthrough, Riftium is made by a plant it takes a lot of time to produce at least some of it.
cryochamber_item3a+++;Riftium is amusing, it can merge with any acid or liquid and have a lot of variety what will happen, the most insane its with sulfuric acid because it will merge itself plus work like a normal acid. It can cut walls in half.
cryochamber_item3a++++;David gave me a letter for Alice if to give it to her if he dies, now he is dead but I`m not sure. I love her too so what will happen. probably the best way is to keep it to myself.
cryochamber_item4?;There is a cabinet its closed what if there is something in it?
cryochamber_item4a;Well it is. now you need to fight a frost enemy FIGHT
laboratory_item0?;There are some flasks on the ground, some of them are broken, yet some are still intact and there are some liquids inside.
laboratory_item0a;Looks like some flasks have still name on themselves, One have name sulfuric acid, you took it with you.
laboratory_item1?;Someone here have a computer. its look active. it may prove vise to scan it
laboratory_item1a;Computer turns on. you can now reed the files inside. but lot of data are corupted.
laboratory_item1a+;Frost data. from the portal was insane. Their architecture, culture, even knowledge is far superior.
laboratory_item1a++;We have discovered something like a shrine, maybe a portal who knows, team has been dispatched to scan the area
laboratory_item1a++;Looks like a vault, there are many arts around, some speak about heroic actions, some about the end maybe a prophecy
laboratory_item1a+++;We have opened a path to vault there is some puzzle, Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit. ;
laboratory_item1a++++;Solution found we have opened it, but something is wrong, many frost entities have began swarming through the vault they are very resistant, but we need to know more
laboratory_item1a+++++;There are something beyond our power, mostly there are thing called frost hero they are almost immune to our weapons we need to retreat.
laboratory_item1a++++++;There is nothing less only corruption and some screams
laboratory_item2?;There is some machine still running wonder why?
laboratory_item2a;They call it fate spinner its an alien artefact from a planet you dont know, better not disturb it
laboratory_item3?;On the floor is lying a corpse of a man. what if is something in his pockets
laboratory_item3a;You found a keycard this one is pink and have  A B C D E letters there is also a director written on it
laboratory_item4?;Why is here a gun turret you may want to investigate.
laboratory_item4a;This weapon is a new MechTech shield it has multiple gun systems if someone can man it frost will have a bad time.
controlroom_item0?;There is a server room curently offline you can activate it.
controlroom_item0a;Systems go, AA guns active, searching for targets, firing now, all targets down.
controlroom_items1-3?;There are three computers in here you can interact with each
controlroom_item1a;Weapons control is here there are some systems here that can be useful one is auto-turrets, some rocket systems, and a shield
controlroom_item2a;This looks like data fortress, you can access here some data from main servers
controlroom_item2a+;The base is online we are now installing the portal, systems are working, there will be up to 20 people in here so small community im looking forward to it
controlroom_item2a++;Scientist teams are working now, i have also noticed two people they look like in love, fortunately it will not endanger our mission
controlroom_item2a+++;So we scouted about 30 worlds and yet no signs of some advance technology, but we discovered that if you add to a human some material they will gain power to manipulate objects
controlroom_item2a++++;Project Vulcan is returning profit. On X28461256 we have found a large patch of gold and some other rare materials
controlroom_item2a+++++;We are shutting this place down it's too dangerous, shit portal is activating who did that, Everyone go back retreat, turn back. We need th shut the portal down, or we are dead
controlroom_item3a-;You have the card you can access some data here, portal is drawing the power from the reactor you can shut it down if you are in a hallway, first floor
controlroom_item3a+;Here you can stay and skip time to end the game now and see the results there is no going back now
controlroom_item3a-+;If you see this you can activate the last secret ending. have fun. and thank you.;you need to be here at turn 39
controlroom_item3a+++;Alice come to you, why it has to be you but ok I sense some dark energy from the portal, we may be all dead soon so I want to say one last thing, I like you, but you will probably not sorry about saying it out loud
controlroom_item3+a+;I love you too
controlroom_item3+a-;Its normal for people to love someone
controlroom_item3+a++;She replied: at least I will live free now, she hugs you, then suddenly you fly across the room. Im back
controlroom_item3+a-;You see a large Frost enemy, breaking your people apart but then he began flying and dies same fate meet other enemies, its done time to return home
basic_dialog0?-;There isn't anyone to talk to
basic_dialog0?+;What do you know about this room?
ending_bad:;Capitan stood on a rock witnessing a foe much stronger that he can handle. Entire unit was massacred by them, soon they took the building and turned it into a fortress
ending_bad+;After base saw what was going on they sent entire army to purge those monsters, many warriors met their end, but at least the threat is gone. Is it?
ending_neutral;Cable car was fully operational co commander sent as many people he could spare to be evacuated, rest gave their life to buy them time and it was enough     Hi im surpised you lost, but hopefully you will replay this and win this oke?
ending_neutral+;Many made it out alive, Survivors are sent back into the base camp while troops went for the attack, thanks to the info from them frost creatures didnt stand a chance. In the end the will be a funeral for the deeds of commander and the rest who gave their lives to save rest.         Hello there  you won, but do you think this is the best ending. you can try again
ending_bitter;Frost Spirit apeared from the portal, thanks to the overwhelming firepower and tactical advantage, he is killed but took some warriors down, later they found your body. Funeral was good, you died so they were capable to live. Congratulation you won.
ending_good;You see alert. Warning a large frost creature has been detected. main enterace is closed, so you look out of the window to see the chaos. Massive frost creature that is probably the Frost Spirit beeing annihilated by commander.
ending_good+;Later you see that some didnt make it out alive but most did, now the journey have started.     You have reached the good ending but this isn't the only end here maybe there is a way how to save everyone?
ending_love;Alice stops, then suddenly you faint away, after some time you wake up in the hospital, while there are some people there you see a smile
ending_love;Well well well, I hope you didn't expect this, I believe we have made it thanks to you and Alice, so my natural assumption is to give you two some time alone, Alr boys move out
ending_love;I thank you to help me find myself there, my reward will be large but now lets keep it as this: she kissed you      Ok gg you won and got a girlfriend or smt, Gleba
