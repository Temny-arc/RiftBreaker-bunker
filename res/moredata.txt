hallway_item1a+-;This plan, what would it entail, exactly?
hallway_item1a++;"Plan?" Well, might be how Rouge operates. I say you grab the hottest iron you can find, stride to the Bunker front door and cut your own path to the Portal.
hallway_item1a+++;If Control is so outside, like data points it is. You`ll just have to find a car.
hallway_item1a++-;If I gotta die, rather fall into my grave gun in hand and on fire. And not draw anyone down with me.

kitchen_item2a;There is a knife, It's something at least.
kitchen_item3?;Someone left data-tablet on the table. There may be some data in it.
kitchen_item3a;Tablet have mostly data about some Frost creatures Frost-Baller, Frost-Hunter, Frost-Necromancer and something called as Frost Spirit. You can find more if you want to
kitchen_item3a+;"Frost-Baller" is creature looking as a human. Its best ability is throwing snowballs. By using some magic(we still dont know how) it can increase durability of the snowball. It main problem is legs are really weak.
kitchen_item3a++;"Frost-Hunter" is refered for beeing identical with cave men. Has perfect perception, can track down almost everything. They are pact so you mostly newer run into only one. if you hurt his head it will be almost dead.
kitchen_item3a+++;"Frost-Necromancer" also known as Summoner creates other frost enemies he probably also controls them so killing one can have huge Impact on others. He himself is weak but since he is protected by others its always strong foe.
kitchen_item3a++++;Frost-Spirit: we expect to be a leader of the Frost people, yet we are not sure if its some mental connection or Person behind it all. if you ever encounter him, know that he can be defeated by huge power only.
